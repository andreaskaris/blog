### Understanding the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

The basics for Horiontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) are well explained in:

* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-apis](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-apis)
* [https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.html](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.html)

For OpenShift 4.x, consider that there is a bug with the `v1` API for autoscaling. However, the `v2beta2` API works fine:

* [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5428871](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5428871)

#### Getting the examples

Clone the following repository. Then, go to directory `hpa-test`:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/andreaskaris/kubernetes.git
cd kubernetes/hpa-test
~~~

You will find all required resources for the following steps. See `REAME.md` in case you want to build your own `hpa-tester` image.

#### Deploying an HPA tester deployment

First, deploy the HPA-Tester deployment. The deployment runs 2 applications which simulate a cumulative load.  Meaning that `COMBINED_CPU_MS` and `COMBINED_MEMORY_MB` will be divided by the number of replicas for the deployment and each pod will then individually run that fraction of memory and CPU load. This check happens every `SLEEP_TIME` seconds.

Deploy the deployment in a dedicated namespace with:
~~~
oc apply -f role-list-deployments-pods.yaml
oc apply -f role-binding-list-deployments-pods.yaml
oc apply -f deployment-hpa-tester.yaml
~~~

If you change the replica count, the `entrypoint.sh` will make sure to distribute the memory MB and CPU ms between the number of replicas.

#### Scaling basics based on the average CPU scaler metric

For the most basic example, `.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources` is:
~~~
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1000m"
            memory: "1024Mi"
~~~

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will by default compare a pod's actual CPU usage to the pod's requested values:
[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
~~~
For per-pod resource metrics (like CPU), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics API for each Pod targeted by the HorizontalPodAutoscaler. Then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request on the containers in each Pod. If a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly. The controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted Pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.

Please note that if some of the Pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, CPU utilization for the Pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric. See the algorithm details section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
~~~

That also means that it is required to set resource requests for the containers.

~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-wgmct   1/1     Running   0          3m2s
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get podmetrics
NAME                          CPU     MEMORY      WINDOW
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-wgmct   1611m   4218724Ki   5m0s
~~~

~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc describe pod hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-wgmct | grep Requests -A2
    Requests:
      cpu:     1
      memory:  1Gi
~~~

When starting with the above configuration, the current CPU utilization for the pod is 1600ms / 1000ms (a request of one full CPU unit, and a cumulative load of 1600 ms), meaning the load is 160%

Now, deploy the following HPA resource:
~~~
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: hpa-tester
  namespace: test
spec:
  maxReplicas: 20
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-tester
  metrics: 
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu 
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
~~~

The target load is 60%.

Looking at the algorithm data for this simple example:
~~~
desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )]
~~~

That means `ceil[1 * ( 160% / 60 % )] = 3`

Let's test this:
~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc apply -f hpa.yaml 
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/hpa-tester created
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE               TARGETS         MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
hpa-tester   Deployment/hpa-tester   <unknown>/60%   1         20        0          3s
~~~

After a while, we will see that the HPA scaled the deployment to 3 pods:
~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE               TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
hpa-tester   Deployment/hpa-tester   55%/60%   1         20        3          3m34s
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-c5hfj   1/1     Running   0          3m20s

[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get podmetrics
NAME                          CPU    MEMORY      WINDOW
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-c5hfj   543m   1413984Ki   5m0s
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-lk2pv   533m   1439692Ki   5m0s
hpa-tester-7bff6856bd-wgmct   547m   1447412Ki   5m0s
~~~

#### Scaling based on absolute CPU values

It is also possible to scale for a specific CPU value. First, scale back the deployment to 1 replica or delete and recreate it. Then, apply the following `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`:
~~~
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: hpa-tester
  namespace: test
spec:
  maxReplicas: 20
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-tester
  metrics: 
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 200m
~~~

And wait for 5 minutes. The result will be 9 pods - ceil [(1600ms + overhead) / 800ms]:
~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get hpa

#### Scaling based on memory utiliation

It is also possible to scale for a specific memory utiliation. First, scale back the deployment to 1 replica or delete and recreate i
t. Then, apply the following `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`:
~~~
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: hpa-tester
  namespace: test
spec:
  maxReplicas: 20
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-tester
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 100
~~~

Apply the HPA and verify:
~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc apply -f hpa.yaml 
oc ghorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/hpa-tester created
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get hpa

[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc describe hpa hpa-tester

Min replicas:                                             1

~~~

And wait for 5 minutes. With 0 overhead inside the pods, the result be 4 pods - 4096 MB (cumulative Memory) / 1024 MB (request container spec) = 400%, then 400% / 100% = 4). Given that the cumulative memory utilization will be a bit higher than 4096 MB, HPA will scale out to 5 pods:

#### Scaling based on absolute memory values

It is also possible to scale for a specific CPU value. First, scale back the deployment to 1 replica or delete and recreate i
t. Then, apply the following `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`:
~~~
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2

    resource:

Verify after deploying this HPA:
~~~

### Combining CPU and memory metrics

It is also possible to combine CPU and memory targets. For example:
~~~
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: hpa-tester
  namespace: test
spec:
  maxReplicas: 20
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-tester
  metrics: 
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "2048Mi"
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "200m"
~~~

Verification:
~~~
[root@openshift-jumpserver-0 hpa-test]# oc get hpa
NAME         REFERENCE               TARGETS                         MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE

~~~

Wait for a short while and the memory metrics will already lead to a scale-out to 3 pods:
~~~
